# Search Application

This is a simple application I use to search my training directories.

## Usage

```bash
    search "ASP.Net Core|Docker|Kubernetes"
```

This will search for directories containing multiple search phrases separated by the ``|`` symbol.

**Note:** double quotes are used to allow searching for phrases containing spaces.
